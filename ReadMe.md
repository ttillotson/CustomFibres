# CustomFibres

## What is it

CustomFibres is a showcase of Erik Baker's side business of producing quality carbon fiber products. Though most of his work is creating carbon fiber covers for car pieces, he does do construction.

## How does it work

### Covers

Wrap the piece in carbon fiber and apply multiple layers of resin. Polish and reduce resin layer for a presentable piece.

### Construction

Wrap the piece in carbon fiber, apply resin. Repeat before removing piece mold and applying several additional layers to the inside. Apply appropriate framing to make piece structually sound.
